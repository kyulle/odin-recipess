# Odin Recipes

This is a simple HTML project where I will create a basic recipe website.  
The goal is to practice the foundational HTML skills I have learned, including:

- Using proper HTML boilerplate
- Adding headings, paragraphs, lists, and links
- Structuring content into multiple pages
- Linking pages together

By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated my ability to structure a basic website using HTML and navigate between different pages.
